# Docker build for code or die - python version

This docker build relies on the
[fork of code-or-die by Julian Zucker](https://github.com/julian-zucker/code-or-die.git).

## Installation

Run ``docker-build-run.sh`` to build the container and run a temporary 
container afterwards. Port 80 will be exposed on the docker host.
